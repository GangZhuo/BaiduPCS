/*
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Stack-Less JIT compiler for multiple architectures (x86, ARM, PowerPC)
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Short description
    Advantages:
      - The execution can be continued from any LIR instruction. In other
        words, it is possible to jump to any label from anywhere, even from
        a code fragment, which is compiled later, if both compiled code
        shares the same context. See sljit_emit_enter for more details
      - Supports self modifying code: target of (conditional) jump and call
        instructions and some constant values can be dynamically modified
        during runtime
        - although it is not suggested to do it frequently
        - can be used for inline caching: save an important value once
          in the instruction stream
        - since this feature limits the optimization possibilities, a
          special flag must be passed at compile time when these
          instructions are emitted
      - A fixed stack space can be allocated for local variables
      - The compiler is thread-safe
      - The compiler is highly configurable through preprocessor macros.
        You can disable unneeded features (multithreading in single
        threaded applications), and you can use your own system functions
        (including memory allocators). See sljitConfig.h
    Disadvantages:
      - No automatic register allocation, and temporary results are
        not stored on the stack. (hence the name comes)
      - Limited number of registers (only 6+4 integer registers, max 3+2
        scratch, max 3+2 saved and 6 floating point registers)
    In practice:
      - This approach is very effective for interpreters
        - One of the saved registers typically points to a stack interface
        - It can jump to any exception handler anytime (even if it belongs
          to another function)
        - Hot paths can be modified during runtime reflecting the changes
          of the fastest execution path of the dynamic language
        - SLJIT supports complex memory addressing modes
        - mainly position and context independent code (except some cases)

    For valgrind users:
      - pass --smc-check=all argument to valgrind, since JIT is a "self-modifying code"

   The executable code is basically a function call from the viewpoint of
   the C language. The function calls must obey to the ABI (Application
   Binary Interface) of the platform, which specify the purpose of machine
   registers and stack handling among other things. The sljit_emit_enter
   function emits the necessary instructions for setting up a new context
   for the executable code and moves function arguments to the saved
   registers. The number of arguments are specified in the "args"
   parameter and the first argument goes to SLJIT_SAVED_REG1, the second
   goes to SLJIT_SAVED_REG2 and so on. The number of scratch and
   saved registers are passed in "scratches" and "saveds" arguments
   respectively. Since the saved registers contains the arguments,
   "args" must be less or equal than "saveds". The sljit_emit_enter
   is also capable of allocating a stack space for local variables. The
   "local_size" argument contains the size in bytes of this local area
   and its staring address is stored in SLJIT_LOCALS_REG. However
   the SLJIT_LOCALS_REG is not necessary the machine stack pointer.
   The memory bytes between SLJIT_LOCALS_REG (inclusive) and
   SLJIT_LOCALS_REG + local_size (exclusive) can be modified freely
   until the function returns. The stack space is uninitialized.
